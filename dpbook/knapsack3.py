"""
Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
In the 0-1 Knapsack problem, we are not allowed to break items. We either take the whole item or donâ€™t take it. 

Input: 
Items as (value, weight) pairs 
arr[] = {{60, 10}, {100, 20}, {120, 30}} 
Knapsack Capacity, W = 50; 

Output: 
Maximum possible value = 240 
by taking items of weight 10 and 20 kg and 2/3 fraction 
of 30 kg. Hence total price will be 60+100+(2/3)(120) = 240
